# Use Case 4

<hr>

**Use Case**: *Pixel Change & Drag*

**Primary Actor**: *User/UI*

**Goal in Context**: *Allow the user to change the color of a pixel and then drag that color wherever the mouse hovers*

**Preconditions**: *Program must be open and running, user must select a pixel, feature must be activated*

**Trigger**: *(1) Clicking the mouse on a pixel. (2) Pressing and holding left mouse click (3) Dragging the mouse across desired areas on the screen.*
  
**Scenario1**: *User clicks a single pixel to change its color. User presses and holds the left mouse button. User drags mouse across desired ares on the screen to change pixel colors*
 
**Exceptions**: *Program becomes unresponsive, user should restart the program through the task manager. Program is unresponsive, color change does not occur, user should trigger the click again.*

**Priority**: *Low Priority*

**When available**: *Third Release*

**Channel to actor**: * The primary actor communicates through I/O devices, specifically, the mouse. The system is responsible for changing pixel colors when the user clicks followed by a left click and hold. The system should respond within 1 second of any mouse click. The user is responsible for all other input*

**Secondary Actor**: *NA*

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: *NA*

**Open Issues**: *An undo option should be available when users push the button by mistake or change their mind about their design. Future integration with keyboard color change feature would improve this functionality.*
