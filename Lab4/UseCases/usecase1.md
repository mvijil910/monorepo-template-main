**Preconditions**: *Program should be launched by the user*

**Trigger**: *User launches the program, program instantiates the canvas space at 600x400 (600 pixels wide, 400 pixels high)*
  
**Scenario1**: *The user launches the program and the canvas is created at  600x400 (600 pixels wide, 400 pixels high)*
 
**Exceptions**: *The program may become potentially unresponsive. In this case, the program can be terminated from the operating system and relaunched by the user.*
