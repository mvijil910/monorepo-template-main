# Use Case 2

<hr>

**Use Case**: *Number to Change Color*

**Primary Actor**: *User*

**Goal in Context**: *Use keys 1-8 to change draw color*

**Preconditions**: *Program must be running and in responsive state. Draw feature enabled.*

**Trigger**: *1) user pushes a color 1-8 2) program changes draw color 
1 = Black
2 = White
3 = Red
4 = Green
5 = Blue
6 = Yellow
7 = Magenta
8 = Cyan*
  
**Scenario 1**: *A user pushes a number 1 to change color to Black*

**Scenario 2**: *A user pushes a number 2 to change color to White*

**Scenario 3**: *A user pushes a number 3 to change color to Red*

**Scenario 4**: *A user pushes a number 4 to change color to Green*

**Scenario 5**: *A user pushes a number 5 to change color to Blue*

**Scenario 6**: *A user pushes a number 6 to change color to Yellow*

**Scenario 7**: *A user pushes a number 7 to change color to Magenta*

**Scenario 8**: *A user pushes a number 8 to change color to Cyan*
 
**Exceptions**: *The program may become potentially unresponsive. In this case, the program can be terminated from the operating system.*

**Priority**: *mid*

**When available**: *second release*

**Channel to actor**: * The primary actor communicates through I/O devices. This includes the keyboard numbers. The system is responsible for changing the visual color when the user pushes the corresponding number, and should respond within 1 second of any keyboard event. The user is responsible for all other input*

**Secondary Actor**: *NA*

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: *N/A*

**Open Issues**: *Users should be able to seamlessly transition to different colors and switch back based on the selected key*
